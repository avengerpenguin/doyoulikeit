# Voting

Voting is the primary focus of the website. Users should be able to vote as
to whether they like, dislike or are indifferent to a thing.

## Casting

A user may click one of the three "Yes", "No" or "Meh" buttons to cast their
vote.

- it should allow a user to vote "Yes" on a thing
- it should allow a user to vote "No" on a thing
- it should allow a user to vote "Meh" on a thing
- it should prevent a user from voting on something already voted on

## Onward Journey

- it should remain on the same thing page after a vote is cast
- it should tell a user "You like it." if they are viewing a thing they have liked
- it should tell a user "You don't like it." if they are viewing a thing they have disliked
- it should tell a user "You have no strong opinion about it." if they are viewing a thing they have dismissed
